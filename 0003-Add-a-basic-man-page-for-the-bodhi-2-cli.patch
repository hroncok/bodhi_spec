+bodhi CLI man page
+==================
+
+Synopsis
+========
+
+``bodhi`` COMMAND SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...
+
+
+Description
+===========
+
+``bodhi`` is the command line interface to bodhi, Fedora's update release management system. It can
+be used to create or modify updates and overrides.
+
+
+Options
+=======
+
+Most of the commands will accept these three options:
+
+``--help``
+
+    Show help text and exit.
+
+``--password <text>``
+
+    A password to authenticate as the user given by ``--user``.
+
+``--staging``
+
+    Use the staging bodhi instance instead of the production instance.
+
+``--user <username>``
+
+    Many commands accept this flag to specify which user's updates should be operated upon.
+
+
+Commands
+========
+
+There are two commands, ``overrides`` and ``updates``. They are described in more detail in their
+own sections below.
+
+``bodhi overrides <subcommand> [options] [args]``
+
+    Provides commands to aid in management of build overrides. Supports subcommands ``query`` and
+    ``save``, described below.
+
+``bodhi updates <subcommand> [options] [args]``
+
+    Provides an interface to manage updates. Supports subcommands ``comment``, ``download``,
+    ``new``, ``query``, and ``request``, described below.
+
+
+Overrides
+=========
+
+The ``overrides`` command allows users to manage build overrides.
+
+``bodhi overrides query [options]``
+
+    The ``query`` subcommand provides an interface for users to query the bodhi server for existing
+    overrides.
+
+``bodhi overrides save [options] <nvr>``
+
+    Save the build root given by ``<nvr>`` as a buildroot override. The ``save`` subcommand supports
+    the following options:
+
+    ``--duration <days>``
+
+        The number of days the override should exist, given as an integer.
+
+    ``--notes <text>``
+
+        Notes on why this override is in place.
+
+
+Updates
+=======
+
+The ``updates`` command allows users to interact with bodhi updates.
+
+``bodhi updates comment [options] <update> <text>``
+
+    Leave the given text as a comment on a bodhi update. The ``comment`` subcommand
